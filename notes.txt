opencv Notes:

Linux OpenCV Install Process:
nav to directory, I chose: ~/programs
$ wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.x.zip
$ unzip opencv.zip
$ rm <4.x.x>.zip
$ mv opencv-4.x opencv
$ mkdir build && cd build

//cmake with proper flags (static libs, and proj install dir):
$ cmake ../opencv -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/andrew/code/c++/src/missal_image_proc/deps
$ make -j4
$ cmake --build . --target install




Project install versus system install. Post below with a few pointers:

//cmake build
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66004186/how-can-i-use-opencv-without-running-make-install

The solution would be to set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to a specific location:

    # in opencv/build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/path/to/deps/
    cmake --build . --target install

Then, configure your project with the same prefix:

    # in your project/build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/user/path/to/deps/

In your cmake files, simply use find_package(OpenCV)
